Project Name: Pop Movies
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I developed Pop Movies, a dynamic web platform where users can explore their favorite movie genres, select specific films, view movie ratings, and enjoy fun facts about each title. To enhance user engagement, I also designed a merchandise section featuring trendy movie figurines and items. This section includes appealing visuals to boost customer interaction, along with a user-friendly online shopping platform for purchasing movie merchandise.
